    <img src="">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These cookies have the perfect fat/sugar/chocolate ratio! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients (24 cookies)</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>125g of butter</li>
      <li>125g of sugar (half brown, half white)</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>175g of flour</li>
      <li>1 tsp of baking soda (or 1 portion of baking powder)</li>
      <li>150g of chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix the sugar and the butter together with a fork until homogeneous. The butter should be soft but not liquid, to make mixing easier.</li>
      <li>Add the egg and mix again.</li>
      <li>Add the flour and the baking soda and mix until the dough is homegeneous.</li>
      <li>Finally, add the chocolate chips and mix.</li>
      <li>Pre-heat the oven at 180°C.</li>
      <li>Take two oven trays and put baking paper on them. With the dough, make little balls of the size of a walnut and place them on the tray. Space them enough so that they will have space to melt flat without fusionning. I usually make around 24 cookies.</li>
      <li>Put the trays in the oven at 180°C during about 10 minutes, until the edges start to be brown.</li>
      <li>Take them out of the oven. The cookies will solidify while cooling down.</li>
      <li>Enjoy your delicious cookies!</li>
    </ol>
